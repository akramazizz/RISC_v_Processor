# RISC_v_Processor
## About the Project.
This single-memory RISC-V processor implementation to be run using Vivado by adding the
top module RISC_V to a project along with the modules file.

## Supported Instructions.
This program supports the 38 instructions; All of RV32I set except JAL and JALR
This program supports only simulations and is not Test to work on the FPGA board. 

### Test Cases
Test cases to test several programs can be found in the file called Test Cases.

##### This project was part of the requirements for Computer Architecture course at AUC
